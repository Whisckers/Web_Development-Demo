<h1>General Information</h1>

<h2>Removal from the Voters' Roll</h2>
  <pclass="justified-text">
   Voters are removed from the Voters' Roll when they die or de-register as a voter. To de-register as a voter, you need to make an appointment <br>at your local IEC office to complete
   a deregistration form. For identification purposes, please remember to take your valid green ID book, <br>smartcard ID or temporary identity certificate along with you.
  </p>
  
<h2>When to update your registration details</h2>
 
 <p>
   You must update your registration details when:
<ul>   
<li>Your address changes</li>
<li>Your ID number changes (e.g. new ID number due to change in date of birth).</li>
  </p>  
 
  <p class="justified-text">
    To be able to vote, you must register as a voter. Once you've registered your details appear on the voters' roll, which contains over 20 million names.
	<br>The voters' roll helps us plan an election and identify fraud as it tells us how many voters to expect in each voting district.

 <h2>How to Register/Update/Inspect the Voters' Roll</h2>
 
 <p class="justified-text">
   You can inspect the voters' roll, register or update your registration details either at your local IEC office during office hours, or at your voting station on special registration days.
   To find out more about who can register as a voter and how to register, please see How do I register? 
   The voters' roll closes for an election on the day that the date of the election is proclaimed in the government gazette.
